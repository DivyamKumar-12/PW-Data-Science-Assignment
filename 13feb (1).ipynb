    "\n",
    "Use try-except blocks judiciously: Use try-except blocks only where necessary. Don't use them for control flow, as it can make the code harder to read and maintain.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use finally block: Always use a finally block after a try-except block if you need to perform cleanup actions, such as closing files or releasing resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "Don't raise unnecessary exceptions: Don't raise exceptions that are not needed. Raise an exception only when you need to communicate an error condition to the calling code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use built-in exceptions where possible: Use built-in exceptions, such as ValueError and TypeError, whenever possible. Don't create custom exceptions unless necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "Document exceptions: Document the exceptions that can be raised by your code, and include information on how to handle them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use context managers: Use context managers, such as the \"with\" statement, to automatically close resources like files and sockets when they are no longer needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Log exceptions: Use logging to record exceptions and errors, along with relevant information like the stack trace and any inputs that caused the exception."
